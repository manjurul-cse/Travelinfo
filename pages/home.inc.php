	Famously poor and heavily prone to flooding, Bangladesh makes an unlikely tourist destination, and a trip here is certainly off the beaten track.
Bangladesh has more than 8,000km of navigable waterways and boarding a boat along a river is a quintessential Bangladesh experience.
Predominantly agricultural, Bangladesh is rural bliss for many travellers and wherever you go you'll enjoy vistas that are beautifully lush and wonderfully green. Nowhere is this more the case than in the gentle hills of the northeast.
If you're happy to leave behind your home comforts and willing to get out and explore, this beautifully green and wonderfully welcoming country could be one of the most fascinating places you ever visit.
Tempted? Here is a guide to the star attractions of one of the least visited countries in south Asia.
It just goes to show how much the world has to learn about the trendsetting, breathtaking and hard-working country that is Bangladesh.
